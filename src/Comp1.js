          lived his whole life in Qatar. I only go to Sudan on Vacations or
          special occasion. I live with my parents and 3 brothers, two younger
          than me and one older.

          I registered for CNA-Q and got accepted for the winter semester of
          2016. Non of my family members had ever studied here before, so it was
          a new experience for me.{" "}
